# Manifesto - Team mishMash

## Team Culture 👩‍👩‍👦‍👦
---
* There is no such thing as a stupid question
* Malleability - be willing to adjust to people/circumstances/etc.
* Wanting/helping each other to succeed
* Focus on team experience/success over personal goals
* Everyone has a voice/opinion that is heard
* Promote psychological safety for all team members
* No expectation of work after 5pm
* Honour each process > rushing to the end

## Decision Making 🤔
---
* Dot voting for brainstorming session to narrow down options
* Poker voting system for checking in on opinions
* Roman voting for making final decisions
* Coin flip to break deadlock

## Recovery
---
* Change topic, go and work on something else while you digest
* Allow a cooling off period

## Our Agile Workflow
---
* Standup at day start - 9am
* After-lunch check-in - 1.30pm
* Retro at day end - 4.30pm

## Coding
---
* Focus on simple, early MVP
* No coding the project alone - all paired programming
* Every React component should have at least one test
* Commit code every step of the code
* Use Git branching and reviewing - review as a team during group sessions
* Add clear comments to code
* Follow SoC guidelines for filenaming and structure
